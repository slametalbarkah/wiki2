            Helen Arney is a British presenter, stand-up comedian and musician. She has toured with the Uncaged Monkeys alongside comedian Robin Ince and Professor Brian Cox.<br/><br/>Described as a "geek songstress" by the Edinburgh Reporter, Arney plays the ukulele as one third of the Festival of the Spoken Nerd, accompanied by stand-up mathematician Matt Parker and television scientist Steve Mould.  She and Parker are also commentators on nearly every episode of You Have Been Warned (Outrageous Acts of Science).<br/><br/>After performing songs which she felt were "just quirky and different" at a science show organised by Robin Ince, she realised that she could "add science and music together in a meaningful way".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Appearances ==<br/><br/>At the 2012 Boring Conference, Arney gave a presentation entitled "Features and Specifications of the Yamaha PSR-175 Portable Keyboard (Discontinued)."<br/><br/>Arney presented a section of an episode of the BBC's natural history series Coast in 2015.<br/><br/>Arney was guest presenter on Episode 97 of No Such Thing as a Fish where she explained the fact that "Tomorrow will be the longest day of your life."<br/><br/>In January 2017 Arney appeared on BBC Radio 4's Museum of Curiosity. Her hypothetical donation to this imaginary museum was a set of samples of the four most recently discovered chemical elements: nihonium, moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson.<br/><br/>She sometimes collaborates with her sister Kat Arney, a science communicator.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Writing ==<br/><br/>In 2013, Arney wrote a piece in the Financial Times entitled "You've got to laugh", in which she promotes the power of comedy in communicating scientific principles.
