<h1>Gilbert Hughes</h1>
            
            Gilbert Hughes (by 1917–2 October 1985) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as a senator in the brief 2nd Seanad of 1938, and as a member of Dublin City Council from 1948 until 1969.<br/><br/>Hughes worked as a labourer and later an insurance agent; he lived in North Wall and later Raheny in Dublin. He joined Fianna Fáil in the 1920s. He supported Éamon de Valera at the party's 1933 ardfheis regarding the replacement of the Free State Seanad, and welcomed de Valera to the party's aeríocht in Dalymount Park in 1935. In 1937 he was Secretary of the North Dock party cumann that objected to Kathleen Clarke's criticism of the new Constitution.<br/><br/>In March 1938 the first election was held for the Seanad created by the Constitution. The Labour Party and Irish Congress of Trade Unions boycotted the election in protest at the inclusion of the tiny pro-Fianna Fáil Ballingarry Cottage Tenants' Association as a nominating body on the Labour Panel. In consequence, de Valera as Taoiseach was required to add three names to the nominating bodies subpanel of the Labour Panel to reach the minimum of six candidates. Hughes was one of these three. Under the rules of the time, the 132 candidates from all ten subpanels were listed on a single ballot, with the 43 senators indirectly elected via single transferable vote by an electoral college comprising 330 public representatives.
