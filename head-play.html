            Head Play (April 2, 1930 – December 11, 1954) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 1933 Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series of races and as the horse on the losing end of the "Fighting Finish" of the 1933 Kentucky Derby.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early racing career ==<br/><br/>Trainer Willie Crump, a former top jockey, bought Head Play for $500 at a yearling sale and gave him to his wife Ruth to race under her name. At age two, Head Play broke his maiden in his second start. He went on to win the one and one sixteenth mile Hawthorne Juvenile Stakes in December at Hawthorne Race Course in Cicero, Illinois, before being freshened over the winter. In his three-year-old season, with jockey Herb Fisher aboard he won the Derby Trial Stakes at one mile at Churchill Downs on opening weekend. After that impressive win, in which he beat a number of the Kentucky Derby eligibles, the Crumps accepted a $30,000 offer for the colt from Suzanne Mason, wife of construction contractor Silas B. Mason whose consortium built the Grand Coulee Dam. With jockey Fisher on Head Play again, he finished second by a nose to Brokers Tip ridden by Don Meade after a battle between the two jockeys so severe they would both be suspended by the racing authorities.<br/><br/>Convinced that Head Play would have won had it not been for the jockeys antics, his new connections entered Head Play in the $25,000 Preakness Stakes run at a mile and three sixteenth at Baltimore's Pimlico Race Course. In the time leading up to the race, he began uneasy in the paddock, bucking and exhibiting fractious behavior  and was unable to be placed in the stall for saddling. In the race, he broke from gate four as the post time 2-1 favorite.
