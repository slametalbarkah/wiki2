            Geoffrey Gerard Gillam FRCP (28 January 1905 – 15 February 1970) was a British medical doctor and consultant cardiologist who became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.<br/><br/>During the Second World War he was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in Normandy and British India, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Born in Holt, Norfolk, Gillam was a son of Dr Joseph Beckett Gillam by his marriage to Dorothy Jane Skrimshire, whose family had practised medicine since the eighteenth century. Educated at Epsom College between 1913 and 1923, he played for the cricket First XI, was head prefect and school captain, and was offered both a scholarship in Classics at Clare College, Cambridge, and a closed scholarship to read medicine at University College Hospital (UCH) which was reserved for boys from Epsom College. His father had died young, before he entered the school, and financial considerations caused him to choose UCH. While there, he took a prize called the Lister Gold Medal, and in the final stages of his training was house physician to the cardiologist Sir Thomas Lewis, then migrated to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital as house surgeon to Athelstan Jasper Blaxland. After his Conjoint diploma in 1927, he gained the degrees of MB and BS (London) in 1928.<br/><br/>His brother John Gillam also became a doctor and ended his career as a consultant in Wales.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Gillam's career as a physician began at Bungay, Suffolk, where he established himself as a general practitioner and remained for almost ten years, gaining a reputation for devotion to his patients and an unhurried approach. He then returned to London to gain higher qualifications, in 1938 graduating MRCP and MD (London). The Second World War followed, and he joined the British Army, serving overseas in Normandy and India and ending the war as a Lieutenant-Colonel.
