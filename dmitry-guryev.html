            Count (from 1819) Dmitry Alexandrovich Guryev (January 18, 1758 – October 12, 1825, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian statesman, Court Master of the Court (from January 1, 1797), Senator (from October 20, 1799), Manager of the Imperial Cabinet (August 26, 1801 – September 30, 1825), Minister of Appanages (July 9, 1806 – September 30, 1825), member of the State Council (January 1, 1810 – April 22, 1823), third Minister of Finance of Russia (January 1, 1810 – September 30, 1823). Father of Alexander Guryev and Nikolai Guryev, father-in-law of Count Karl von Nesselrode-Ehreshoven. Actual Privy Councillor.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origin and rise ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Born into an impoverished Russian nobility, the Guryev family, he was the son of foreman Alexander Guryev (died in 1788) and his wife, Anna Eropkina. He was baptized on January 13, 1758, in the Simenov Church, godson of Count Sergei Yaguzhinsky. He was educated at home and began serving on November 17, 1772, as a soldier in the Izmailovsky Life Guards Regiment, a week later he was promoted to corporal. In 1773, he received the rank of sergeant, in 1779, he was made an ensign, in 1782, a second lieutenant, a year later (1783) a lieutenant and on November 1, 1785, a lieutenant captain.<br/><br/>The quick start of Guryev's career was greatly facilitated by his personal connections, in particular – the patronage of Count Pavel Skavronsky, grateful to Guryev for deftly arranging a profitable marriage for him with Yekaterina von Engelhardt, the niece of Potemkin:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Guryev was never good or smart; only at that time was he young, fresh, hefty, white and blush, at the same time extremely searching and agreeable; he wanted to get into people at all costs, and blind happiness heard his prayers. He accidentally met a young, effeminate millionaire, Count Pavel Martynovich Skavronsky, the grandson of Catherine I's brother, who was going abroad. Guryev knew how to please him, even to master him, and for more than three years traveled with him in Europe.
