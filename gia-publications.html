            GIA Publications, Inc. is a major publisher of hymnals, other sacred music, and music education materials that is currently located in Chicago. The organization was initially the publishing arm of the Gregorian Institute of America (1941–1965); a school affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church that was initially established in Pittsburgh but operated for the majority of its history in Toledo, Ohio. The school specialized in training choral conductors in the methods of teaching choirs to sing Gregorian chant. After the school's closure following the Second Vatican Council, the publishing part of the school was sold to the Harris family.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Gregorian Institute of America ==<br/><br/>The Gregorian Institute of America was originally named the Catholic Choirmasters Correspondence Course. Established in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1941, the organization was founded by Clifford Bennett as a summer institute for liturgical music. When the school oriented its focus onto Gregorian chant, the name was changed to the Gregorian Institute of Pittsburgh. In 1945 the school relocated to Toledo, Ohio and at this time its name was changed to the Gregorian Institute of America. The school remained in operation in Toledo until it closed following its 1965 Summer Institute course offerings.
