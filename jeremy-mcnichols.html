As a youngster, McNichols and fellow NFL player John Ross played in Snoop Dogg's youth football league in Long Beach, California. He played running back and wide receiver in high school, and his versatility led to him earning the nickname "McWeapon". During his career he rushed for 877 yards with nine touchdowns and had 72 receptions for 934 yards and 10 touchdowns. He originally committed to the University of Utah to play college football but later changed to Boise State University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== College career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>McNichols enrolled at Boise State in early August 2014 before the start of fall camp. Heading into the season, McNichols planned on being redshirted and sat out the first five games before the redshirt was pulled.
