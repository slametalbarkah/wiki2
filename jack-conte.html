            Jack Conte (; born July 12, 1984) is an American musician and co-founder and CEO of Patreon. He and his wife Nataly Dawn comprise the musical duo Pomplamoose, and he is co-leader of the band Scary Pockets and founder of the band Magaziine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Conte began his career as a video game voice actor, contributing the voice for all teen male sims in the 2004 bestseller The Sims 2.<br/><br/>Conte created his YouTube channel in 2007 to upload music videos inspired by the Dogme 95 movement. He gained widespread attention when his video Yeah Yeah Yeah was featured on YouTube's front page. Most of Conte's music videos follow a format called "VideoSongs", defined by two rules: no lip-syncing for instruments or voice ("what you see is what you hear") and no hidden sounds ("if you hear it, at some point you see it").<br/><br/>In 2008, Conte formed the band Pomplamoose with Nataly Dawn, who later became his wife. The band garnered significant fan support, primarily through their YouTube videos.<br/><br/>Much of Conte's work has been met with positive reviews, citing evocative lyrics in Sleep in Color and creative delivery of his VideoSongs. However, Conte's music was reviewed less favorably by Amplifier: "Hints of Conor Oberst, Radiohead, Patrick Watson, contemporary punk rock (screamo), radio power pop, and incalculable other singer songwriters are more than borrowed, making for a short mishmash of electro rock."<br/><br/>On May 7, 2013, Conte announced the launch of Patreon with co-founder Samuel Yam.
