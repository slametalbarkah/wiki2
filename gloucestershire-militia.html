            The Gloucestershire Militia was a part-time military force in the county of Gloucestershire in the West of England. From their formal organisation as Trained Bands in 1558 until their final service as a Special Reserve unit of the Gloucestershire Regiment in World War I, the Militia regiments of the county served in home defence in all of Britain's major wars.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The English Militia was descended from the Anglo-Saxon Fyrd, the military force raised from the freemen of the shires under command of their Sheriff. It continued under the Norman kings, notably at the Battle of the Standard (1138). The force was reorganised under the Assizes of Arms of 1181 and 1252, and again by King Edward I's Statute of Winchester of 1285. Now Commissioners of Array would levy the required number of men from each shire. The usual shire contingent was 1000 infantry commanded by a millenar, divided into companies of 100 commanded by centenars or constables, and subdivided into sections of 20 led by vintenars. Edward I regularly summoned the shire levies of Gloucestershire to fight in neighbouring Wales during his Welsh Wars, but they were not required for his Scottish campaigns. However, his grandson Edward III, did employ the Gloucestershire levies in Scotland, for example at the Siege of Berwick and Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333. Rather than 1000 men, the Gloucestershire contingent serving from 23 June to 23 August 1335 was a more manageable body of 218 longbowmen (16 of them mounted), commanded by two ductores (constables) and 11 vintenars.
