<h1>Goodman Mitileni</h1>
            
            Wisani Goodman Mitileni, sometimes also spelled Mtileni, is a South African politician who represented the African National Congress (ANC) in the Limpopo Provincial Legislature from 2014 to 2021. He resigned from the legislature after being elected Regional Secretary of the ANC's Mopani in June 2021 and the favorite to take over as the regional chairperson of the ANC in Norman Mashabane region . Less than a year later, in March 2022, he was elected as Provincial Chairperson of the Limpopo branch of the South African Communist Party (SACP).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== ANC Youth League ==<br/><br/>Mitileni joined the ANC as a teenager and served as the secretary of a local branch in 1993 to 1994 while he was in his last year of high school. He remained active in the ANC and ANC Youth League (ANCYL) in subsequent years while he qualified, and then worked for five years, as a teacher. He later entered public administration as a youth development officer in the Mopani District Municipality, in which capacity he became a regional leader of the South African Municipal Workers' Union (SAMWU). In December 2005, he was elected simultaneously as Provincial Chairperson of SAMWU's Limpopo branch and as Provincial Deputy Secretary of the ANCYL's Limpopo branch. <br/><br/>In the ANCYL role, he deputised Julius Malema, and in 2008, he became acting Provincial Secretary of the Limpopo ANCYL after Malema was elected to more senior office as national ANCYL President. Mitileni continued in that position until the league's next provincial elective conference, held in Makhado in April 2010. Mitileni – along with his deputy Thandi Moraka and ANCYL Provincial Chairperson Lehlogonolo Masoga – was part of a group that led a walkout from the Makhado conference, protesting against what they described as Malema's attempts to interfere in the conference and install his allies in leadership positions.
