            Juraj Bartusz (born 23 October 1933) is a Slovak sculptor known for his time-space statues and for his non-conventional approach to statue and object from the mid-1960s until the present. "In 1972 he started to work with the computer, cooperating with the computer programmer Vladimír Haltenberger. Computer generated curves were used as a template for manufacturing rotational, human-like sculptures." "The broad spectrum of author’s work includes constructivist sculpture, action and conceptual art, site-specific art, as well as installation. In the eighties he started working with the time factor and began to create time-limited paintings and drawings, and model his works by forceful hits, e. g. throwing bricks to solidifying plaster or slamming the material with planks or rubber straps, referring to the energy of the author’s gesture."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>During the 1960s, he was a part of the Club of Concretists (Klub Konkretistov known as Concrete art), led by art historian Arsen Pohribny. Juraj Bartusz was the husband of woman sculptor Mária Bartuszová (between 1961 – 1984). His current wife is poet Jana Bodnárová. He was a professor of Arts at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava (1990-1999); later he established and he is academically active at the Art and Intermedia Department of the Technical University in Košice (since 1999). In 1992 he was appointed to the professorship at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague (Czech Republic).
