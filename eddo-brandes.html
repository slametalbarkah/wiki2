            Eddo André Brandes (born 5 March 1963) is a Zimbabwean former cricketer who played in 10 Tests and 59 ODIs from 1987 to 1999, spanning four World Cups. In the days when a number of Zimbabwean players were amateurs with other full-time professions, Brandes was a chicken farmer. Brandes was the first Zimbabwean player to take a hat-trick in the ODI format.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Brandes was born on 5 March 1963, in Port Shepstone, Natal Province, South Africa. He was the son of a German father and a South African mother. He and his family moved to Rhodesia the year after he was born, and he grew up on a farming property.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== International career ==<br/><br/>Although selected for the 1983 Cricket World Cup squad, Brandes did not make his official One Day International debut until the 1987 Cricket World Cup in Zimbabwe's opening match against New Zealand in a close 3 run defeat at the Niaz Stadium, being run out without facing a ball, attempting a single with Iain Butchart and pulling his quadriceps muscle before he could complete the run.<br/><br/>Brandes first win with Zimbabwe at a World Cup came in 1992 against England at the Lavington Sports Ground in Albury, Australia. Defending 134, Brandes bowled a ten-over unbroken spell, taking four wickets for 21 runs, including England captain Graham Gooch and one-time Zimbabwe player Graeme Hick, in a famous nine-run victory. He played for Zimbabwe in a further two World Cup tournaments.
