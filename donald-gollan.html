            Donald Herbert Louis Gollan (19 January 1896 – 13 August 1971) was a British rower who competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics, winning silver. He was partially deaf and communicated using British Sign Language.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Sport career ==<br/><br/>Gollan was born in Paddington, London, the son of Spencer Gollan, a racehorse owner and keen sportsman from New Zealand. He started his sport career as a competitive swimmer, encouraged by his father.<br/><br/>He was a member of both Thames Rowing Club and Vesta Rowing Club. He was initially a single sculler and first entered the Wingfield Sculls in 1914. He was probably excused from war service owing to his disability.<br/><br/>In 1920 Gollan was runner up to Jack Beresford in the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta and in the Wingfield Sculls. From 1920 he was Beresford's toughest competitor in the Wingfield Sculls which in 1921 were decided on a foul after Beresford's boat was holed in a clash with Gollan. Both scullers were being steered by their fathers and so in 1922 it was decided that fathers of competitors should not act as pilots or steer the cutters.
