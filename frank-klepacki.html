            Frank Klepacki (; Polish: [klɛˈpat͡skʲi]) is an American musician and video game composer, best known for his work on the Command &amp; Conquer series. Having learned to play drums as a child, he joined Westwood Studios as a composer when he was 17 years old. He has scored several games there, including the Lands of Lore series, Westwood Studios' Dune games, The Legend of Kyrandia series, Blade Runner, and the Command &amp; Conquer series. His work in Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert won two awards.<br/><br/>He lives in Las Vegas, where he has shaped a solo career and played and produced for several local bands. His personal and band work touches upon several genres, including orchestral, rock music, hip hop music, soul music, and funk. He has dubbed the style of music he writes as "Rocktronic". His work has appeared in various media, including the Spike TV program The Ultimate Fighter.<br/><br/>Klepacki is currently the audio director of Petroglyph Games, where he scored Star Wars: Empire at War. Klepacki was contacted to score Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, but was too busy with Petroglyph to take the project, and declined to mention the offer.
