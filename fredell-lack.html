            Fredell Lack (February 19, 1922 – August 20, 2017) was an American violinist.  Noted as a concert soloist, recording artist, chamber musician, and teacher, she was the C. W. Moores Distinguished Professor of Violin at the Moores School of Music at the University of Houston in Houston, Texas.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and musical training ==<br/><br/>Fredell Lack was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the oldest of three children of Jewish Eastern European (Latvian) immigrants, Abram I. Lack and Sarah Stillman Lack (who was a sister of noted painter Ary Stillman). She began violin lessons at age six, studying with Tosca Berger.  When Fredell was 10, she moved with her family to Houston, Texas.  There she studied with Josephine Boudreaux, the concertmaster of the Houston Symphony.  At age 11, she first soloed with orchestra, performing the Wieniawski Concerto No. 2 with the Tulsa Philharmonic.  At 12, Lack was accepted into the New York City studio of the legendary violinist and pedagogue Louis Persinger, whose other students included such artists as Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern, and Ruggiero Ricci.  She moved to New York and completed her pre-college schooling at the Bentley School while continuing her violin lessons with Persinger.
