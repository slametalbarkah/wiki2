Produced under Fireworks Productions, it starred Sana Sayyad, Nyra Banarjee, Sangita Ghosh, Adhvik Mahajan and Mishkat Varma.<br/><br/>It was dubbed into Kannada as Divya Drushti and aired on Star Suvarna.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>The story starts with a pregnant woman, Vidya, meeting with her Guruji. They talk about Pishaachini, an evil pishaachini and a former disciple of Guruji, who is going after three powerful and magical gems of Lord Shiva which are with him. If she gets all three of the gems, she will become so powerful no one will be able to stop her. Guruji had given two of the gems, the Tatva Ratna, with the power to control the elements, and the Mayavi Ratna, with the power of illusions and mind control, to two of his disciples for safekeeping. Pishaachini, however, killed these disciples with her magic and acquired both the gems, which she wears on a pendant, and their powers. She is now after the third and the most powerful of the three gems, the Kaal Vijay Ratna, which has the power to give visions of the future and the power to change the future, which is with Guruji himself. Vidya and Guruji go to his cave, where Pishaachini appears and asks Guruji for the Kaal Vijay Ratna.
