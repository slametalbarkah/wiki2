            Elizabeth Waller (born 1943 in Cheshire, England) is a British costume designer for theatre, television and film. She began her costume career in theatre, before joining the BBC costume team, where her period costume work was acclaimed for its attention to detail. Married to cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts since 1974, Waller is an Ambassador for The Bright Foundation, an arts education charity.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Theatre design ==<br/><br/>Waller won a bursary to study Theatre Art and Design at Wimbledon School of Art, graduating in 1966. In September that year, as part of the Arts Council designer trainee programme, she started working as Assistant Designer at the Phoenix, Leicester, where she designed costume for Widowers Houses and Live Like Pigs. <br/><br/>Waller continued to design costumes for theatre productions while working at the BBC. In the late 1970s she designed 'striking' costumes for The Recruiting Officer at the Crucible in Sheffield, and later, a series of productions for Peter Hall Company in the late 1990s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Elizabeth R (1971) ==<br/><br/>By 1970, Waller was working at the BBC, where her early projects included adaptations of The Spoils of Poynton and She Stoops to Conquer. Waller was part of a new generation of BBC designers working for colour television, and were subsequently given the title and credit of 'costume designer', and provided with a distinct budget for creating garments. Before 1968 the job of dressing actors had been performed by the wardrobe supervisors, who mainly used stock costumes. <br/><br/>Waller's breakthrough project was the six-episode BBC series Elizabeth R, starring Glenda Jackson as the Tudor monarch, which aired in 1971.
