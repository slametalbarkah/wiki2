            Between 1937 and 2024, an estimated 2,000 people jumped to their suicide from the Golden Gate Bridge, located in the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States.<br/><br/>Prior to the installation of suicide prevention barriers, some would die instantly from internal injuries, while others drown or die of hypothermia. People who have survived the jump have had severe consequences including paralysis, organ damage, broken bones and lifelong pain. Most jumpers incorrectly think that jumping will lead to an instant death.<br/><br/>Installation of metal suicide barriers that stretch 20 feet out from the walkway was completed in January 2024. Additional prevention measures include telephone hotlines and patrols by emergency personnel and bridge workers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Prevention and intervention ==<br/><br/>Various methods have been tried to physically prevent people from jumping off the bridge. As of January 2024, it was fitted with a suicide prevention barrier, suicide-hotline telephones, and staff patrol the bridge in carts, looking for people who appear to be planning to jump. The bridge is now closed to pedestrians at night. Cyclists are still permitted across at night, but are required to buzz themselves in and out through the remotely controlled security gates.
