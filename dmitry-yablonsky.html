            Dmitry Albertovich Yablonsky (Russian: Дмитрий Альбертович Яблонский) (born 1962) is a Soviet-born American-israeli classical cellist and conductor, who was educated at the Juilliard School of Music and Yale University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Yablonsky was born in Moscow into a musical family, his mother is famed pianist Oxana Yablonskaya and his father is Albert Zayonts, who was solo oboe of the Radio and Television orchestra in Moscow for 30 years.<br/><br/>Yablonsky began playing the cello when he was 5 years old and was accepted into the Central Music School for gifted children. At the age of 9 he gave his orchestral debut playing Haydn's cello concerto in C major.  In Russia, Yablonsky studied with Stefan Kalianov, who was Mstislav Rostropovich's assistant and Isaak Buravsky, who for many years was solo cello of the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. Before immigrating to the United States he performed on many occasions in Moscow and many cities of the former Soviet Union. Leaving the Soviet Union was not that easy in the 1970s, and the visa application was first refused and it took a few years and many signatures from many well known personalities such as Leonard Bernstein and Katharine Hepburn to convince the Soviet authorities to issue a visa to allow his mother to leave the country. Shehe originally wanted to emigrate to Israel like many so-called refuseniks at the time; due to her emigration application, she was dismissed from  her job at the Moscow Conservatory and Yablonsky was ostracized by school staff.<br/><br/>Upon arrival in New York in 1977, he auditioned to the Juilliard School of Music and was accepted to study with Lorne Munroe, the principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.<br/><br/>In the summer of 1979, at the age of 16, Yablonsky was accepted to participate at Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont and was the youngest participant that summer.
