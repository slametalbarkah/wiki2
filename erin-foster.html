            Erin Foster (born August 23, 1982) is an American writer, actress and producer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Erin Foster was born on August 23, 1982, in Los Angeles, California, to record producer David Foster and former model Rebecca Dyer. She is the middle sister of actress Sara Foster and fashion stylist Jordan Foster. After her parents divorced in 1986 when she was four years old, she and her sisters were raised by her mother. Foster later attended boarding school in Switzerland.<br/><br/>Through her father's previous marriage to B.J. Cook, Foster is half-sister of songwriter Amy S. Foster. Through her father's later marriages to Linda Thompson in 1999 and Yolanda Hadid in 2011, she was stepsister to television personalities Brody and Brandon Jenner and models Gigi and Bella Hadid. <br/><br/>Foster has said she resented her father's distance growing up, saying on her podcast, "I was dealing with my whole own emotional turmoil, which was watching my father raise other children. They had a very different life." She and her sisters struggled with being perceived as spoiled rich kids: "We did not have a trust fund; we had to have a job."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>In the early 2000s, Foster began her acting career, appearing in Castle, The O.C., House, American Dreams, Gilmore Girls, Reno 911!, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Judging Amy, and Roswell.<br/><br/>Foster later transitioned to writing and producing.
