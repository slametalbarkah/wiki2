During his senior season, he was a teammate of future Pittsburgh Steelers offensive guard Gerry Mullins. In college, Fassel played quarterback at Fullerton College, USC, and Long Beach State.  He was drafted as a quarterback in the 7th round by Chicago in the 1972 NFL draft and had a short playing career with the Bears, San Diego Chargers, and Houston Oilers in 1972.<br/><br/>Fassel played briefly with The Hawaiians of the WFL in 1974,  and became an assistant coach during the 1974 WFL season. He left the WFL after the '74 season, but briefly returned when the Hawaiians needed a quarterback late in the 1975 season. He played in the final game of the WFL for the Hawaiians, throwing the last pass in the league's history as the WFL folded three days later on October 22, 1975.
