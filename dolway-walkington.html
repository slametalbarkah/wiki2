<h1>Dolway Walkington</h1>
            
            Dolway Bell Walkington (25 January 1867 – 18 April 1926) was an Irish rugby union player and solicitor. Walkington played club rugby for North of Ireland FC and international rugby for Ireland, winning eight caps. Although captaining Ireland twice, he is more often remembered for his poor eyesight and the fact that he occasionally wore a monocle while playing, removing it when required to make a tackle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Rugby career ==<br/><br/>Walkington was born in Belfast in 1867. His brother, Robert Walkington, was an Irish international player before him, and later became the President of the Irish Rugby Union. The brothers never represented Ireland together, Robert playing between 1875 and 1881, and Walkington from 1887 until 1891.<br/><br/>Walkington was first called to play for Ireland in the country's opening game of the 1887 Home Nations Championship against England. It was an historic game, as Ireland beat the English for the very first time, after 12 unsuccessful attempts. Walkington missed the next game of the tournament at home to Scotland, but was reselected in the final game which saw Ireland lose to Wales at Birkenhead. The Irish team and Walkington had their revenge the next year when Wales were beaten at Lansdowne Road, but it would be two years until Walkington played for Ireland again.
