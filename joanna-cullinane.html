            Joanna Cullinane is a New Zealand academic, and is a full professor at Massey University, specialising in management and employment relations. As of 2024 she is Deputy Pro-Vice Chancellor of the Massey Business School.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Academic career ==<br/><br/>Cullinane completed a PhD titled The political economy of employment relationships in New Zealand at the University of Waikato in 2003. Cullinane moved to the UK, and completed a Masters in Human Resource Management at the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales). She also was lecturer in organisational behaviour and Deputy Head of Division at the University of Glamorgan. She was Dean Academic at Coventry University London, and Director of Learning and Teaching at the University of Greenwich. Cullinane returned to New Zealand and joined the faculty of Massey University in 2017, rising to full professor in 2024. As of 2024 she is Deputy Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Massey Business School and chairs the Academic Progress committee. Cullinane played "an instrumental role" in the formation of a partnership between Massey University and Nanjing University of Finance and Economics (NUFE). During the period of the COVID-19 pandemic when New Zealand's borders were closed to foreign students, Massey opened a learning centre at NUFE for their Chinese students to continue their qualifications, and this led to the establishment of a joint educational institute based at NUFE in 2022.
