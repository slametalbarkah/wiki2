            Eleanor Glencross (11 November 1876 – 2 May 1950) was an Australian feminist and housewives' advocate. She led the Housewives' Association of New South Wales and she was the first chair of the Federated Association of Australian Housewives. She expelled members from the association and she was bankrupted by a successful defamation suit that followed. Canberra named a street after her.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Glencross was born Eleanor Cameron in Sydney to unionist and politician Angus Cameron and Eleanor, née Lyons. She attended Cleveland Street Public School and Mis Somerville's Ladies' College and worked for the Liberal and Reform Association. She became general secretary and organiser of the Australian Women's National League in 1911 before returning to Sydney in 1913 to work for the Liberal Association of New South Wales. On 14 March 1917 she married Andrew William Glencross at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, moving to Stawell later that year and vigorously supporting the pro-conscription campaign.<br/><br/>Glencross was appointed honorary director of the prohibitionist Strength of Empire Movement in 1918, and worked for various temperance organisations. She became president of the Housewives' Association of Victoria in 1920 and the founding president of the Federated Association of Australian Housewives in 1923, working for a lower cost of living.
