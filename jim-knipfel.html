            Jim Knipfel (pronounced Kah-nipfel) is an American novelist, autobiographer, and journalist.<br/><br/>A native of Wisconsin, Knipfel, who suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, is the author of three memoirs, Slackjaw, Quitting the Nairobi Trio, and Ruining It for Everybody; as well as two novels, The Buzzing, and Noogie's Time to Shine. He wrote news stories, film and music reviews, the crime blotter, and feature articles until June 13, 2006, for the weekly alternative newspaper New York Press.<br/><br/>He also wrote the long-running "Slackjaw" column for the Press. The first edition of "Slackjaw" appeared on October 25, 1987, in the Welcomat, a Philadelphia weekly (later renamed the Philadelphia Weekly), where he also reviewed restaurants and art exhibits.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Youth and early career ==<br/><br/>Knipfel was born on June 2, 1965, in Grand Forks, North Dakota on the American air base where his father was then stationed. Before he was a year old, the Knipfel family moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin where his father continued to work for the U.S. Air Force for many years and his mother worked in a variety of jobs. In his teens, he was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called retinitis pigmentosa, which would progressively render him blind in later years. His first memoir, Slackjaw, chronicles the deterioration of his eyesight.<br/><br/>In his teens, while the family was living in Green Bay, he suffered from bouts of severe depression.
