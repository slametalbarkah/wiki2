            Janusz Wiesław Stawarz (born 1 December 1959) is a Polish former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. His playing career was spent with Stal Mielec and Lechia Gdańsk, making 188 appearances in Poland's top division, as well as featuring twice for the Poland national team.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Club football ===<br/><br/>Born in Łętowice near Tarnów, he played in the youth sides for his local team Unia Tarnów. In 1977 he joined the biggest team in the region, Stal Mielec. During the 1978–79 season Stawarz made his first senior league appearances, playing twice in the league as Stal finished in an impressive third place in the I liga. The following season Stawarz found himself becoming the first choice keeper, and was the first choice keeper for the 1981–82 season when Stal once again finished in third place in the Polish championship, with Stawarz making 22 appearances in the process. After the initial success he enjoyed with Stal while at the club, their competitiveness started to wane, with the team being relegated the following season. The club did not again return to the I liga while Stawarz was at the club, with Stawarz deciding to leave Stal midway through the 1984–85 season. In total he made 93 top flight appearances with Stal Mielec.<br/><br/>Stawarz joined Lechia Gdańsk in January 1985, making his debut for the club on 10 March 1985 against Górnik Wałbrzych.
