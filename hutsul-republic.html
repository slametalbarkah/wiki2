            The Hutsul Republic (Ukrainian: Гуцульська Республіка, romanized: Hutsulska Respublika) was a short-lived state formed in the aftermath of World War I. Inhabited by Hutsuls, the republic was declared on 8 January 1919, when original plans to unite this area with the West Ukrainian People's Republic failed and the territory was occupied by Hungarian police.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The legislature of the Hutsul Republic was the "Ukrainian People's Council" with 42 members, and its executive power (government) was the "Council" with 12 members.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Creation ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>On 20–22 December 1918 Hungarian troops returned to the territory of the Hutsul Republic. A state of emergency was proclaimed, the Hutsul militia units disarmed, the Ukrainian People's Council was liquidated, the Hungarian language was restored in school and in government communication, and former Hungarian officials were appointed to all posts of the local government.<br/><br/>On the night of 7–8 January 1919 the local population of Rahó (Rakhiv) rose against the Hungarian gendarme battalion, taking into custody some 500 Hungarian policemen. General Stepan Klochurak was elected prime minister of the republic. He was also active in organizing the armed forces of the republic, which consisted of nearly 1,000 soldiers. On 17 January 1919 the army waged a brief confrontation against the occupying Romanian troops in Máramarossziget (Sighetu Marmației), in the adjacent lands of Máramaros County. This unequal battle resulted in the Hutsul Republic suffering, according to various data, 18 to 41 people killed, 39 to 150 people wounded, and 400 people taken prisoner including 20 officers.<br/><br/>The day after the "Unification Act" was signed on 23 January 1919 by the Ukrainian People's Republic and the West Ukrainian People's Republic Stepan Klochurak and Julian Braschaiko joined the "Labor Congress" of this new entity as representatives of the Hutsul Republic.
