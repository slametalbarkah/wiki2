            Editha Grace Knocker (2 March 1869 – 19 September 1950) was an English violinist, conductor, teacher and author. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Knocker was born in Exmouth, Devon, the youngest of six children of Royal Navy officer Hugh Horatio Knocker and Rosa Hensley (sister of Prince Edward Island politician Joseph Hensley). When Knocker was born her father was patrolling the coast of West Africa as commander of the gun vessel HMS Fly. He died of a fever at sea four months after Knocker's birth. <br/><br/>Knocker studied the violin with Joseph Joachim in Berlin from 1889 to 1890. Upon her return to England she settled in York, where her mother lived, and taught at various schools, including The Mount School. A diagnosis of neuritis in her arm thwarted her plans for a career as a solo performer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Teaching career ==<br/><br/>In 1898, along with T. Tertius Noble, she was one of the co-founders of the York Symphony Orchestra. She was one of the conductors of the orchestra and also played the role of lead violin.<br/><br/>In 1913 Knocker was invited to be an assistant to Leopold Auer at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, but had to return to England on the outbreak of World War I in 1914.
