He later attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and second-class honours in the Classical Tripos. Cust initially pursued a career in law and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1888, but he ultimately decided to enter politics. He won a by-election for Stamford, Lincolnshire in 1890 and served in Parliament until the general election of 1895.
