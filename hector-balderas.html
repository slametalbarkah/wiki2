            Hector Hugo Balderas Jr. (born August 16, 1973) is a distinguished lawyer, executive leader, and public servant who has dedicated his career to advancing justice, accountability, and educational opportunity in New Mexico. A trailblazing Hispanic leader, Balderas has broken barriers in public service, becoming one of the most prominent Hispanic voices in the state’s history. Currently serving as the President of Northern New Mexico College, he has previously held key statewide leadership roles, including New Mexico Attorney General (2015–2022), State Auditor (2007–2014), and State Representative (2005 - 2006). Throughout his career, he has been recognized for his commitment to government transparency, corporate accountability, and legal reform. A relentless advocate for consumers, he has fought to protect families from corporate misconduct, rooted out public corruption, and championed policies that strengthen communities and promote equitable access to education.<br/><br/>In 2014, Balderas was the only Hispanic candidate on the statewide Democratic ticket and earned more votes than any other statewide candidate, surpassing both Governor Susana Martinez and U.S. Senator Tom Udall. In 2018, he won re-election as Attorney General with 28,449 more votes than the statewide ticket. His ability to garner broad bipartisan support underscores his significance in New Mexico politics and his role as a transformative leader for the state.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Balderas was raised by his single mother in the rural village of Wagon Mound, New Mexico, where he experienced firsthand the challenges of poverty.
