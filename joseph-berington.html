            Joseph Berington (16 January 1743 – 1 December 1827) was a priest and one of the prominent British Catholic writers of his day.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Joseph Berington, born at Winsley, Herefordshire, was educated at the English College at Douai. After his ordination to the priesthood he was promoted to the chair of philosophy in the university there. In this position his inclination towards liberal opinions became apparent, and his theses, prepared for the exhibition of his pupils, created such a stir that he thought it prudent to resign.<br/><br/>On his return to England, he occupied several positions in turn, each intended to give him leisure to pursue his studies. From 1776 to 1782 he was chaplain to Thomas Stapleton, of Carlton, Yorkshire, acting at the same time as tutor to his son, with whom he afterwards travelled around Europe. In December 1777, while in Paris, he wrote to Benjamin Franklin expressing his disappointment at Franklin's absence from the city at that time, and the hope to meet with him at a later date. He served next at St Mary's College, Oscott, then a lonely country mission, where his cousin, Charles Berington, who had been appointed coadjutor bishop, joined him.<br/><br/>In 1782, Berington was one of the co-founders of the first Catholic Committee, formed to represent the Catholics in their struggle for emancipation; which gained for itself a reputation for its liberalizing principles, and the generally anti-episcopal tendency of its action. The Midland District was the chief centre of these opinions, and fifteen of the clergy of Staffordshire formed themselves into an association of which Joseph Berington was the leader, the primary object being to stand by their bishop, Thomas Talbot, who was partly on that side.
