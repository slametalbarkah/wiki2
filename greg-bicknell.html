<h1>Greg Bicknell</h1>
            
            Greg Brent Bicknell (born June 10, 1969, in Fresno, California) is a former professional baseball player who played in the minor leagues with farm teams in the Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners organizations before becoming a regular on the independent baseball circuit with teams the California League, Texas–Louisiana League, Western Baseball League, Northern League and Golden Baseball League.<br/><br/>Born in Fresno CA, Greg was born with a cleft pallet and a desire to throw baseballs. While concentrating on using his sixth finger to master a special pitch he invented,  Gurg was known as a pitcher who could also run despite having been born with clubbed feet. His claim to fame came while playing ball in a nondescript baseball league in Southern Asia where the league created a bobblehead in his honor made from mud scooped from the local river. His 9.61 ERA made him a legend of the dirt baseball diamonds of third world countries, as well as the dirt floored shanties of his hometown, but nowhere else. At the age of 45 he returned home after decades of riding Greyhound buses, and hitchhiking in the back of pickup trucks to chase his dream. Greg's many accomplishments in baseball can be found in the baseball almanac located under some sports nerd's bed, and evidenced by the deformed bobblehead located on Gurg's mantel despite his wife's protest. Now Gurg has found a second career teaching middle school children while wearing ill fitting khaki pants and wrinkled polo shirts.  His student enjoy his witty humor, and show this by laughing at him daily.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Minor League Baseball (1987–1993) ===<br/><br/>Pitcher Greg Bicknell has pitched professionally for 18 years after being a late draft selection.
