            Freddy Germán Huayta Véliz (born 12 May 1968) is a Bolivian community organizer and politician who served as a party-list member of the Chamber of Deputies from Oruro from 2010 to 2015.<br/><br/>Huayta completed his early schooling in his home community and finished his studies as an adult later in life. After serving as a police officer throughout the 1990s, he retired to work in commerce and began leading and organizing grassroots movements in metropolitan Oruro's peri-urban outskirts. As the leader of his own neighborhood council, Huayta founded the Departmental Coordinator of Peri-urban Neighborhood Councils of Oruro, which he chaired as executive secretary from 2002 to 2010.<br/><br/>In 2005, Huayta was appointed deputy mayor of the Avaroa Canton and was later made departmental counselor to the Oruro prefecture from 2006 to 2008, demonstrating his and the neighborhood councils' close relations with the ruling Movement for Socialism. As a member of the party, he was elected to represent Oruro in the Chamber of Deputies in 2009. At the end of his term, Huayta amicably split with the ruling party and founded his own, Alternative Civic Integration, with which he unsuccessfully contested a seat on the Oruro Municipal Council in 2021.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life and education ===<br/><br/>Freddy Huayta was born on 12 May 1968 in Estancia Jarenilla, a hamlet in the Sud Carangas Province of central Oruro, to Cristóbal Huayta Véliz and Virginia Véliz de Huayta. Raised in rural poverty, Huayta spent his early years accompanying the labors of his father, handling and herding livestock such as cattle and llamas. He completed his primary schooling at the Pedro Domingo Murillo and Túpac Katari schools in his home canton of Avaroa, later moving to adjacent Belén de Andamarca Canton to attend the Simón Bolívar School, at which point he halted his studies.
