            Jon Johanson (born 1956) is an Australian aviator known for his pioneering flights in a home-built Van's Aircraft RV-4. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Johanson was born in 1956 in Warburton, Victoria, the third of four children. His father was a dairy farmer in Bairnsdale, East Gippsland. Johanson had his first solo flight at age 46, following which the family relocated to Horsham, where his interest in aviation grew.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Flights ==<br/><br/>In 1995, Johanson flew easterly around the world and made a stop over flight at Oshkosh, Wisconsin at the EAA. In 1996 he made another stop over flight to Oshkosh, Wisconsin for the EAA, then Johanson flew his second around the world flight going westerly. On his third around the world flight in 2000, Johanson set four aviation world records. As he was flying over the North Pole the cold air cracked his windscreen.<br/><br/>In 2003, he made the first solo flight in a single-engine home-built aircraft over the South Pole. After landing at the McMurdo-Scott base he became stranded when the base, not wishing to encourage future private flights, refused to sell him fuel. After a fuel donation by fellow adventurer Polly Vacher, he was able to fly on to Australia, via New Zealand.
