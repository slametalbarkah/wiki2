            Garrick Tremain (born 1941) is a New Zealand cartoonist and painter living in Queenstown.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>He has been a professional painter since 1972 and a cartoonist since 1988. Tremain has produced a cartoon six or seven days a week for various New Zealand newspapers, including the Otago Daily Times, apart from a few months of semi-retirement from February 2007, when he produced weekly cartoons.<br/><br/>He has been a finalist for the Qantas Media Awards Cartoonist in 2000 and 2004.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Controversy ===<br/><br/>On 3 December 2019 the Otago Daily Times published a cartoon by Tremain making light of the measles epidemic in Samoa. At that point the epidemic had killed 53 people, almost exclusively small children. Many people questioned how a cartoonist could think this an appropriate subject for a cartoon, and also why the editor allowed it to be published. Some of Tremain's colleagues at the ODT spoke out against the publication of the cartoon. The Race Race Relations Commissioner Meng Foon called the cartoon a "slap in the face" for the victims' families.<br/><br/>The public response to the cartoon led to an apology by the ODT the same day, in which editor Barry Stewart said "The content and timing of the cartoon were insensitive, and we apologise without reservation for publishing it.”<br/><br/>On 4 December Tremain apologised for his lack of judgment but also referred to the cartoon as a "light-hearted joke" and said he "saw nothing wrong with it".
