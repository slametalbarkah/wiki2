            Elizabeth Anne Scherer (born 1976/1977) is an American lawyer who served as a judge in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida from 2012 until her resignation in 2023.<br/><br/>Scherer gained national attention in 2022 after being randomly assigned to preside over the trial of Nikolas Cruz, the perpetrator of the 2018 Parkland high School shooting in Parkland, Florida, the deadliest high school shooting in United States history as of 2022. Her conduct during the trial was later found to be in violation of rules governing judicial conduct and biased towards the prosecution, resulting in a formal reprimand from the Florida Supreme Court.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life and career ==<br/><br/>Scherer graduated from Florida State University with a B.A. in English and received a J.D. from the University of Miami School of Law. She is the daughter of William R. Scherer, a private attorney who was part of the legal team representing George W. Bush during the 2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida. Before being appointed as a judge by Governor Rick Scott in 2012, Scherer worked as a prosecutor under state attorney Michael Satz, who would later lead prosecution in the Cruz trial.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Parkland shooter trial ===<br/><br/>Judge Scherer had been relatively unknown outside of  Broward County until being assigned to preside over the high-profile case of the Parkland shooter, Nikolas Cruz. Her conduct in the case drew both praise and criticism. Scherer permitted the jury to conduct a walk-through of the school building while also limiting the amount of information public defenders were allowed to disclose to jurors regarding the failures of the federal government agencies in handling Cruz prior to the shooting. During the trial, Scherer engaged in heated exchanges with the defense attorneys, accusing them of turning the trial into a "playground" and disrespecting the court.
