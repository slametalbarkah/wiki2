            Edzo Hendrik Toxopeus (Dutch: [ˈɛtsoː ˈɦɛndrɪk tɔksoːˈpeːjʏs]; 19 February 1918 – 23 August 2009) was a Dutch politician and diplomat of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and jurist.<br/><br/>Toxopeus studied Law at the Utrecht University obtaining a Master of Laws degree. Toxopeus worked as a paralegal in Breda from July 1942 until October 1944 and worked as a military lawyer in the Royal Netherlands Army from November 1944 until August 1945. Toxopeus worked as a criminal defense lawyer in Breda from August 1945 until May 1959. Toxopeus became as a Member of the House of Representatives shortly after the election of 1956 when the number of seats was increased from 100 to 150 on 6 November 1956 and served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Law Enforcement and Spatial Planning.<br/><br/>After the election of 1959 Toxopeus was appointed as Minister of the Interior in the Cabinet De Quay taking office on 19 May 1959. Shortly before an upcoming election Party Leader and Parliamentary leader Pieter Oud announced his retirement and Toxopeus announced his candidacy to succeed him and was selected as his successor on 30 March 1963. For the election of 1963 Toxopeus served as Lijsttrekker (top candidate) and following a cabinet formation the coalition continued and Toxopeus retained his position in the Cabinet Marijnen. The Cabinet Marijnen fell just 19 months into its term and was replaced by the Cabinet Cals on 14 April 1965. Toxopeus returned to the House of Representatives on 21 September 1965 but against custom didn't take over as Parliamentary leader immediately and instead served as a frontbencher chairing the House Committee on the Interior and served as deputy parliamentary leader and spokesperson for General Affairs before taking over as Parliamentary leader on 12 March 1966.
