            Jewish medicine is medical practice of the Jewish people, including writing in the languages of both  Hebrew and Arabic. 28% of Nobel Prize winners in medicine have been Jewish, although Jews comprise less than 0.2% of the world's population.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Ancient ===<br/><br/>There are no extant texts of ancient medicine, as a first subject, of Hebrew origin. There was no medicine distinctly Jewish and instead Jewish practitioners had adopted Greek and later Graeco-Roman knowledge as practice.<br/><br/>A text known as the "Book of Remedies" is recorded of in the Babylonian Talmud twice, and the baraita, evidently dating from at least the reign of Hezekiah. Likewise, a text known as Sefer Refuot, which means "book of remedies," is known. However, its composition has been dated roughly to the time of the Byzantine Empire, anywhere from 1,000 and 1,700 years after Hezekiah.<br/><br/>It is possible that folk healers who had knowledge of herbalism, occult practices, and folk magic<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Middle Ages ===<br/><br/>Further Information: Medieval medicine of Western Europe<br/><br/>The Book of Remedies, the earliest medical text written in Hebrew, to Asaph the Jew, dates to the seventh or eighth century. The text comprises four parts; a story of the transmission of medicine from God to mankind, a medical survey, a Materia medica and a list of medical aphorisms. While there is no knowledge of the writer himself or where the text was written, it circulated widely in Jewish communities during the Medieval period, and it can be assumed that it was of great influence to Jewish practitioners during this time.
