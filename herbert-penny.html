            Herbert Penny was a well known Cape Town Auctioneer, Estate and Financial Agent, who was instrumental in the creation of the South African Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves, the precursor to the present day South African Navy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Family and early life ==<br/><br/>Herbert Penny was born 11 January 1867 in Southampton, England. He married Carlotta Elvira de Conceciao Forssman (daughter of Chavalier OA Fossman of Sweden) and had two sons and two daughters. Penny descends from Richard Penny of Marchwood.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Penny arrived in the Cape Colony in 1889 as a ship's officer in the Union Steamship Company that operated a fleet of passenger liners and cargo ships between Europe and Africa.<br/><br/>Prior to the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, Penny served as a company secretary in Johannesburg (during the Jameson Raid in 1895), prior to his appointment as General Manager of a coal mine in Middelburg, Transvaal. During this South African War, the mine was closed and Penny moved to Cape Town at the time hostilities commenced. He joined the staff of a bank and later was Chief Inspector of the Harbour Board. He started his own business, Herbert Penny Pty Ltd., and "Penny for Property" Estate Agents, Auctioneers and Sworn Appraisers, of Lennons Building, 30, Adderley Street, Cape Town, in 1906.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Maritime interests and other activities ==<br/><br/>While having started his career by going to sea, Penny took a keen interest during his later life in the Cape region, in anything connected with the sea.
