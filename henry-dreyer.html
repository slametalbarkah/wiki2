            Henry Francis Dreyer (February 2, 1911 – May 27, 1986) was an American athlete. He competed in the 1936 and 1948 Summer Olympics as a hammer thrower; his other strong event was the non-Olympic weight throw, in which he broke the world record several times. Between the two events and counting both outdoors and indoors, he won twenty United States championships.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Sports career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early career and 1936 Olympics ===<br/><br/>Dreyer won his first national title in 1934, winning the 35 lb weight throw at that year's AAU indoor championships with a throw of 53 ft 8 in (16.35 m). Representing Rhode Island State College, he also won the 1934 indoor IC4A weight throw title, throwing 55 ft 2+1⁄4 in (16.82 m), a world record. At that summer's NCAA championships he won the hammer throw, throwing 169 ft 8+3⁄8 in (51.73 m) and defeating 1932 Olympic bronze medalist Pete Zaremba; only Fred Tootell, the 1924 Olympic champion and Dreyer's coach, had ever thrown farther at the NCAA meet.<br/><br/>In 1935 Dreyer broke his own world record in the 35-pound indoor weight throw with 57 ft 9 in (17.60 m) and repeated as national champion in the event. He also won his first national outdoor title, winning the hammer throw with 168 ft 8+1⁄2 in (51.42 m). The previous week he had thrown 181 ft 5+3⁄16 in (55.30 m) at the New England championships in Newport, the best throw in the world that year.<br/><br/>On 29 February 1936 he threw the indoor weight 58 ft 4+1⁄2 in (17.79 m), regaining the world record from Irving Folwartshny, who had thrown 58 ft 1+1⁄2 in (17.71 m) at the national championships the previous week.
