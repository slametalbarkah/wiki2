            Family Switch is a 2023 American fantasy comedy film directed by McG, written by Adam Sztykiel and Victoria Strouse, and starring Jennifer Garner and Ed Helms. The film is based on the 2010 children's book Bedtime for Mommy by Amy Krouse Rosenthal.  It was released by Netflix on November 30, 2023, and received mixed reviews from critics.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>In Los Angeles, the Walker family: the working couple Jess and Bill, along with their three kids CC, Wyatt and Miles, are a divided family: the parents and the children routinely find themselves at odds, primarily due to their respective outlooks towards life. With Christmas approaching, the convivial parents vainly attempt to draw the emotionally-distant children to spend more time together than individually. During an excursion to the Griffith Observatory to witness a rare planetary alignment, the fissures between the family erupt - with Jess and CC, Bill and Wyatt simultaneously wishing each other to try being them for a more intimate understanding. While asking an astrologer, Angelica, to take a family picture, a blinding flash rocks the observatory; in the melee, the family accidentally damage the telescope.<br/><br/>The next morning, the family awaken to find themselves spiritually split from each other: Jess and CC find themselves in each other's bodies, as do Bill and Wyatt, much to their collective horror. Moving to resolve the quagmire, the family employ their unknowing neighbor Rolf to babysit toddler Miles and family dog Pickles, who were also switched. At the observatory, the family manage to bribe the staff to accelerate the telescope's repairs with the aim of reverting into their original bodies by the end of the planetary alignment.
