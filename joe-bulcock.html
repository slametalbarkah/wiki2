He represented the Southern League XI and the Football Association XI.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Personal life ==<br/><br/>Bulcock was the youngest of three brothers. After professional football was suspended at the end of the 1914–15 season due to the ongoing First World War, he lived in Llanelli and worked as a plumber's mate. Bulcock enlisted as a private in the Welch Regiment in December 1915 and was sent to the Western Front in September 1917. He was wounded at the Fourth Battle of Ypres and died of wounds to the head at 36th Casualty Clearing Station in Watten, France on 20 April 1918.
