Presently, he is the Director of NIPER, SAS Nagar (Mohali). Known for his studies on microtubule dynamics and FtsZ assembly dynamics, Panda is an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, India. The Department of Biotechnology of the Government of India awarded him the National Bioscience Award for Career Development, one of the highest Indian science awards, for his contributions to biosciences in 2005.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Born on 28 January 1964, Dulal Panda did his doctoral studies at Bose Institute to earn a PhD in biochemistry in 1994 and subsequently, did his post-doctoral work at the University of California, Santa Barbara during 1998–2000 as a research associate. On his return to India, he joined the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2000 as an assistant professor at the School of Bioscience and Bioengineering and has been serving the institute since then. During this period, he became an associate professor in 2003 and a professor in 2007, and serves as a chair professor at the School of Bioscience and Bioengineering. In between, he was also associated with the scientific programs in life sciences of the Department of Science and Technology during 2003–04.<br/><br/>Panda resides in Powai, a neighborhood of Mumbai, in Maharashtra.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Legacy ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Panda's cell biological research covered the fields of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell division, dynamics of microtubules and FtsZ, chemotherapeutic treatment protocols, development of FtsZ-targeted antibacterial drugs as well as biomolecular spectroscopy.
