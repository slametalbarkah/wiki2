            Eamont Bridge is a small village immediately to the south of Penrith, Cumbria, England.<br/><br/>The village is named after the bridge over the River Eamont and straddles the boundary between the historic counties of Cumberland and Westmorland. One of the houses in the village is called the "Welcome Inn" and was at one time the "Welcome into Cumberland Inn".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Features ==<br/><br/>There are two ancient sites in the village, namely the earthwork known as King Arthur's Round Table and the much better preserved Mayburgh Henge which is situated between the rivers Lowther and Eamont. Mayburgh Henge was built using stones from one or both rivers. The location between the rivers was probably important when it was built 3000 or 4000 years ago, which protected it from invasion. Both sites are under the protection of Historic England. There was another henge close to King Arthur's Round Table, which is now obliterated. A cup was reputed to have been found at the centre of the King Arthur's Round Table Henge. The gateway from Mayburgh Henge points in the direction of King Arthur's Round Table, which was probably a convenient meeting place for millennia.
