            John Kolasky (Ukrainian: Іван Васильович Коляска, romanized: Ivan Vasyliovych Koliaska; October 5, 1915 – October 20, 1997) was a Canadian-Ukrainian historian and activist. A member of the Communist Party of Canada early in his political career, Kolasky became disillusioned with communism after witnessing repressions of Ukrainians by the Soviet government, and subsequently became an anti-communist activist and supporter of Ukrainian Soviet dissidents in Canada.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>John Koliaska was born on October 5, 1915, in the town of Cobalt, Ontario to a Ukrainian Canadian family from Bukovina. His parents were both members of the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association, and he grew up on a farm near the city of Timmins, where his surname was Polonised to Kolasky. Following the beginning of the Great Depression Kolasky left home and worked various jobs in Timmins, Ottawa, and Winnipeg. His experience with the Great Depression radicalised him into Marxist ideals, and he became a member of the Communist Party of Canada (CPC).<br/><br/>In 1944 Kolasky began studying at the University of Saskatchewan as a historian, graduating in 1948. He also graduated from the University of Toronto in 1950. Over the next decade he became a prominent figure in the CPC, and he was sent to the Higher Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine in 1963 by the Association of United Ukrainian Canadians (the successor to the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association).<br/><br/>In Ukraine Kolasky experienced firsthand the Russification of Ukraine occurring under the Soviet government.
