            Hackwood Park is a large 260-acre (110 ha) country estate that primarily consists of an 18th-century ornamental woodland and formal lawn garden in addition to a 51,681 sq ft (4,801.3 m2) mansion of symmetrical design. It is located within the boundaries of Winslade, a rural parish immediately south of Basingstoke in Hampshire. The parks and gardens are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens and the main house is Grade II* listed on the National Heritage List for England. It was placed on the market in 2016 for around £65 million. As of 2024, it is still for sale at the same price.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The estate was owned by the manor or rectory of Eastrop until 1223, when it became a noble's deer park in its own right. It was acquired by William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester in the 16th-century. The bulk of the structure of the house currently standing was built from 1683 to 1687 for a son of the fifth Marquess, Charles Paulet, created Duke of Bolton. The estate was inherited by his son, Charles Paulet, 2nd Duke of Bolton in 1699, followed by his grandson, Charles Powlett, 3rd Duke of Bolton in 1772. The property was painted by Paul Sandby in 1764.
