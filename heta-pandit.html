            Heta Pandit (born 1954) is an Indian writer, researcher, and heritage activist whose work focuses on preserving and documenting Goa’s architectural and cultural legacy. She has explored both tangible elements, such as historic Goan homes, and intangible heritage, including local customs and practices.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Pandit has conducted extensive research on Goan heritage, gathering stories associated with old houses in the region. She examines how these homes reflect broader cultural narratives, including community traditions and beliefs. She advocates for safeguarding Goa’s architectural wealth, underlining the importance of preserving both natural resources and historic structures.<br/><br/>In 2023, Pandit published Stories from Goan Houses, in which she examines the architectural features, family histories, and cultural practices surrounding old Goan homes. Two years later, in 2025, she authored If Grinding Stones in Goa Could Talk, exploring the cultural significance of everyday objects like grinding stones and their links to local traditions. She has additionally written about the mutual support shown by Goan communities, even in times of conflict, emphasizing the resilient and collective spirit she regards as central to Goan society.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Advocacy and themes ==<br/><br/>Pandit’s writings often stress the cooperative nature of Goan society, describing how local communities have historically supported each other through difficult circumstances. She notes that Goans sometimes even extend help to adversaries during crises, reflecting a strong sense of solidarity.
