            Japanese Tears is the third album by guitarist Denny Laine, released shortly before the demise of Paul McCartney's band Wings, of which Laine was a member. The album was released in 1980.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>In January 1980, Wings planned a tour of Japan.  However, upon the band's arrival at the airport in Japan, Paul McCartney was arrested for marijuana possession.  The tour was cancelled, and McCartney then decided to release a solo album (McCartney II) instead of touring, putting Wings on hiatus.<br/><br/>Laine decided to work on his own solo project (his third since joining Wings), and he released a single, "Japanese Tears". It became the title track of his album.<br/><br/>The album also included three previously unreleased Laine compositions that had been recorded by different versions of Wings between 1972 and 1978 with Laine on lead vocals: "I Would Only Smile" from the Red Rose Speedway sessions, "Send Me the Heart" (co-written with Paul McCartney) from the Venus and Mars sessions and "Weep for Love" from the Back to the Egg sessions. In addition, it featured remakes of the Moody Blues' 1965 hit "Go Now", which was originally sung by Laine and which Laine with Wings performed on tour, and a 1967 Laine composition, "Say You Don't Mind", that had become a top-20 UK hit in 1972 for Colin Blunstone. Some of the songs featured the short-lived Denny Laine Band, which included fellow Wings member Steve Holley on drums, Andy Richards on keyboards and Laine's wife Jo Jo on backing vocals.
