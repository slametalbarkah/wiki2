<h1>John Staff</h1>
            
            Sergeant John Earl Staff (January 14, 1923 – November 25, 1949) was an American soldier. He was one of two known Allied soldiers killed in the line of duty on the border of West Berlin and East German territory between the beginning of the joint occupation of Berlin in summer 1945 and the beginning of the construction of the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Death ==<br/><br/>Staff was on a private trip with two other soldiers and two young women. All three soldiers were wearing uniforms, and in an automobile that was clearly marked as an official US Forces vehicle. On the Hauptstraße in Gatow (in the British occupation sector), near the border between West Berlin and the GDR, they got lost; it remained disputed whether or not they were actually in East German territory. Once the occupants realized that they were lost, and attempted to return to Gatow, they were fired upon by two East German border guards and a Soviet soldier who were posted at the nearby East German border checkpoint. Several bullets hit the car, and Staff was severely wounded by a bullet in his head. His friends took him to the military hospital at the British airfield in Gatow, where Staff died a short time later as a result of the shots.<br/><br/>An American newspaper stated that the vehicle had driven up to the checkpoint, clearly in East German territory, so the driver could ask for directions. It stands to reason that the driver overlooked the hazard of the new border, and did not expect the zeal with which the East German guards and the protective power of their Soviet masters defended the sovereignty of the newly established German Democratic Republic, or the unexpected shooting of a clearly marked military vehicle.
