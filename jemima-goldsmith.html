            Jemima Marcelle Goldsmith (born 30 January 1974), sometimes known professionally as Jemima Khan Goldsmith, is an English journalist and screenwriter. She is the founder of Instinct Productions, a television production company. As a journalist, she was an associate editor for the British political and cultural magazine The New Statesman and European editor-at-large for the American magazine Vanity Fair.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Born at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, Goldsmith is the eldest child of Lady Annabel Goldsmith and financier Sir James Goldsmith (1933–1997). Her mother, from an aristocratic Anglo−Irish family, is the daughter of the 8th Marquess of Londonderry. Goldsmith's father was the son of a luxury hotel tycoon and former Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Major Frank Goldsmith, who was a member of the Goldsmith family of German Jewish descent. Her paternal grandmother was French.<br/><br/>Goldsmith's parents were married to different partners at the time of her birth, but they married each other in 1978 in order to legitimise their children. She has two younger brothers, Zac Goldsmith and Ben Goldsmith, and five paternal and three maternal half-siblings, including Robin Birley and India Jane Birley.<br/><br/>Goldsmith grew up at Ormeley Lodge and attended The Old Vicarage preparatory school, then Francis Holland Girls School.
