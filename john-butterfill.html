In 1962, he began his career as a valuer with Jones Lang Wootton before becoming a senior executive with the Hammerson Group in 1964. He was a director at the Audley Properties Group (now the Bovis Homes Group) from 1969 until he became the managing director of the St Paul's Securities Group. He became a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in 1974. <br/><br/>He was elected as the chairman of the Guildford Conservative Association from 1976 to 1982. In 1977 he became a senior partner in Curchod &amp; Co Chartered Surveyors, where he remained until 1992.
