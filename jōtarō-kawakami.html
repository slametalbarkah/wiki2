            Jōtarō Kawakami (Japanese: 河上 丈太郎, Kawakami Jōtarō; 3 January 1889 – 3 December 1965) was a Japanese politician who was initially the leader of the Right Socialist Party, and then later a leader of the united Japan Socialist Party.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life ===<br/><br/>Hailing from Tokyo's Minato-ku ward, he was the son of a used lumber dealer named Shintaro Kawakami. When Jōtarō was very young, his father became a Christian, which later influenced Jōtarō to become a devout believer, and from the time that Jōtarō was five years old, his father would take him to prayer meetings.<br/><br/>When the church's activity was sluggish, there would be fervent 2-3 hour meetings between the father and son Kawakami along with pastors Kousuke Tomeoka and Shunpei Honma, at which young Jōtarō would often be bored. However, the passionate prayer left a strong impression with him. When the young Jōtarō started schooling, his illiterate father had him read the Old Testament one chapter at a time. In his later years, Jōtarō's father made his wish that his son would become a good politician who would devote himself to the benefit of both God and humans.<br/><br/>At the time that Kawakami was attending Rikkyō Middle School, the daily newspaper known as Yoruzuchōhō (万朝報) carried an article in 1903 by Sakai Toshihiko and Kōtoku Shūsui which criticised the Russo-Japanese War. which developed a strong impression on Jōtarō and led him to develop an interest in socialist thought.<br/><br/>After attending Daiichi High School, Kawakami graduated from Tokyo Imperial University's Law School in 1915 with a specialisation in political science.
