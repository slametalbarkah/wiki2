            Elizabeth "Pat" Roemer (September 4, 1929 – April 8, 2016) was an American astronomer and educator who specialized in astronomy with a particular focus on comets and minor planets. She was well-known for the recovery of lost comets, as well as for her discovery of two asteroids, the co-discovery of Jupiter's moon Themisto, and for the asteroid 1657 Roemera that was named in her honor.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Roemer was born on September 4, 1929, in Oakland, California, and was raised in Alameda, California, by her father and mother, Richard Quirin and Elsie B. Roemer. From a young age, Roemer expressed interest in scientific reasoning and matters regarding astronomy. It was revealed by Roemer in an interview that while she was a freshman in high school many of her teachers lacked the proper qualifications. This was because she was a student during the Second World War, when many individuals were teaching on emergency credentials. One of her general science teachers had made remarks with astronomical implications that Roemer believed to be incorrect. One of these statements was that Polaris was the largest star. Despite not having books or sources that contained the correct answers, Roemer was encouraged to look for the right answers elsewhere. She got in touch with a teaching assistant in the Astronomy Department at Berkeley who helped her find the information she was looking for.
